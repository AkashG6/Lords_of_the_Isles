--intro
Money maketh man in the world of Isles. To grow, to prosper and to expand is the only way of survival.
Your mission is to explore the adventurous lands lost in the vast oceans of an unknown world. 
Trade and own as many Isles and open up your oceanic empire for the exchange of exotic resources.
Sail the seas, win the land, earn the gold and the game is yours !!


--island buying
You will begin the game with one island and a ship at your command. The island harbours a resource that can be traded
(exported) using the ship at your disposal to other players playing the game. 

Every island houses a decent population of inhabitants which pay you taxes, which can be used by you to buy new islands,
which enable you to trade newer resources to increase your wealth.

To buy a new island, you have to click on the dice flickering on the top right corner of your screen. The opportunity
to buy a new island comes only once in a tick (A tick in the game corresponds to 10 minutes of real time).
